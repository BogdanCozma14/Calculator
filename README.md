# Calculator
Calculator made for the final project of the Odin Project Foundations course
I made the buttons for adding numbers to the display and calculating them.
If the user has already introduced two numbers and a symbol for an operation, if he then press again another operation, than the previous operation will be calculated and then the result of it will be displayed on the input with the new operation pressed.
When the user press the button CLEAR, everything that was written will be deleted and the user will start fresh.
I still have to create the code for the DEL button (deleting the last character introduced) and the decimal point and being able to calculate correctly real numbers
